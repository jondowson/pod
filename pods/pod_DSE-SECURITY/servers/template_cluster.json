# INSTRUCTIONS:

# ENSURE BLOCKS use this unique identifier with convention !!!
#                 --> 'server_1','server_2', 'server_3' ...

# tag:            server tag should be relevant and unique - perhaps its hostname
# user:           account used to connect to and setup datastax on remote server
# sshKey:         full path to local copy of server authentication file to use to access remote server
# target_folder:  where 'POD_SOFTWARE' + 'POD_INSTALLS' is located on server
# pubIp:          specify here what will be used to connect - could be internal 'private ip'!
# prvIp:          the private address of the server (e.g. AWS internal ips)

# Note:           for any pod use any server json defintion file that contains its required info (unused values will just be ignored)
# FINALLY:        in the copy of this template, delete all these instructions, leaving just the json !!
