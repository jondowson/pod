## STAGES

##Â Workflow of STAGES through TASKS to ACTIONS
## [1] CALL ALL STAGES - in order from this file:
## --> pod_<NAME>.bash
## [2] FOR EACH STAGE  - use its composition stub function:
## --> generic stubs:           pod_/stages/stage_generic_stubs.bash
## --> pod specific stubs:      pod_<NAME>/stages/stage_stubs.bash
## [3] STAGE STUB FUNCTIONS call STAGE TASKS:
## --> generic tasks:           pod_ 'stages' folder
## --> pod specific tasks:      this pod's 'stages' folder
## [4] TASKS call ACTIONS (functions):
## --> generic functions:       pod_ 'lib' folder
## --> pod specific functions:  this pod's 'lib' folder
