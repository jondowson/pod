# INSTRUCTIONS:

# ENSURE BLOCKS use this unique identifier with convention !!!
#             --> 'server_1','server_2', 'server_3' ...

# tag:            server tag should be relevant and unique - perhaps its hostname
# user:           account used to connect to on remote server
# sshKey:         full path to local copy of server authentication file
# target_folder:  where 'POD_SOFTWARE' + the 'pod' build are put
# pubIp:          specify here what will be used to connect - could be internal 'private ip'!

# FINALLY:        in the copy of this template, delete all these instructions, leaving just the json !!
