# INSTRUCTIONS:

# ENSURE BLOCKS use this unique identifier with convention !!!
#             --> 'server_1','server_2', 'server_3' ...

# tag:            used to display pod messages only - server tag should be relevant and unique - perhaps its hostname
# user:           account used to connect to remote server
# sshKey:         full path to local copy of server authentication file to use to access remote server
# target_folder:  where 'POD_SOFTWARE' will be copied to on remote server
# pubIp:          ip to connect to remote server

# FINALLY:        in the copy of this template, delete all these instructions, leaving just the json !!
